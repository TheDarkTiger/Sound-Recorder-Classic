I couldn't find a fitting licence for this project.
I just want to signify in a more or less square manner that you can read, study, use and modify my code, as long as you say I made the base, share your modifs/forks with the same mentality, and don't make money by selling the base code.
So, please, use your common sense to respect my will.

If you need something more tengible, the closest license is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
But it's just an indication, and not a hard statement.
